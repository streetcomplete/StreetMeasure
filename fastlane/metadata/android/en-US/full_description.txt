<p><i>StreetMeasure</i> is an app to measure distances and heights. It is based on the non-free <i>Google ARCode</i> and thus was separated from the otherwise free/libre open-source <i>StreetComplete</i> a.o. in order to have the latter available at <a href='https://f-droid.org/' target='_blank'>F-Droid.org</a> â€“ and also to make it your choice whether you're willing to accept a non-free component while remaining able to use <i>StreetComplete</i> no matter how you decide.</p><p><i>StreetMeasure</i> was made for usage with StreetComplete and other OpenStreetMap editors. But you can use it for other things, too.</p><p>In order to use this app, you will need to have the proprietary <i>Google Play Services for AR</i> app installed on your device as well.</p>
