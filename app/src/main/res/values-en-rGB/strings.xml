&lt;p&gt;Set each the start- and endpoint while pointing the phone straight down (so that you see the white arrow from above) to completely avoid this issue for horizontal measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For vertical measurements, you need to instead check that the startpoint does not seem to move in relation to the ground by looking at it from different directions.&lt;/p&gt;"</string>
